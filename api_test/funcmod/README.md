# funcmod Example

This folder contains an example module that exports a single default function. This pattern allows:

- Direct calls to the exported function (e.g., `api.funcmod('name')`)
- Simple, single-function API endpoints from a file

By organizing your code this way, you can create focused API endpoints for individual operations, making your codebase easy to use and maintain.
