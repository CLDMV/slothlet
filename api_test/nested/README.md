# nested Example

This folder contains nested folders and modules that demonstrate how to organize API endpoints in a hierarchical structure. This pattern allows:

- Grouping related operations in subfolders for better organization
- Creating deep, discoverable API surfaces that mirror your file structure

By organizing your code this way, you can build scalable and maintainable APIs that reflect logical groupings in your project.
