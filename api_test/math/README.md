# math Example

This folder contains an example module that exports multiple related math functions as an object. This pattern allows:

- Direct calls to each math method (e.g., `api.math.add(a, b)`, `api.math.multiply(a, b)`)
- Grouping related operations in a single API endpoint

By organizing your code this way, you can keep mathematical utilities together, making your API endpoints more discoverable and maintainable.
