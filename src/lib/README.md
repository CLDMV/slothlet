# src/lib Experimental Code

This folder contains experimental modules for the slothlet API loader. The code here is either not working, partially working, or not fully tested. Use at your own risk.

## Purpose

The files in this folder are prototypes and work-in-progress implementations for advanced features in slothlet, such as:

- **slothlet_child.mjs**: Experiments with child process or worker-based API loading and isolation.
- **slothlet_engine.mjs**: Attempts to provide a modular engine for API loading, context binding, and shutdown management.
- **slothlet_esm.mjs**: Explores ES module dynamic loading and compatibility.
- **slothlet_helpers.mjs**: Utility functions for API flattening, key conversion, and module handling.
- **slothlet_worker.mjs**: Prototypes for worker thread-based API execution and communication.

## Status

These modules are not guaranteed to work and may be incomplete, buggy, or subject to breaking changes. They are intended for experimentation and future development, not for production use.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute, please review the code and leave comments or suggestions. Any improvements or bug fixes are welcome, but stability is not guaranteed.
